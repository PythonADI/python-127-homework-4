# How to submit — with a Pull Request

You've never done this before, and that's fine — every step is here.
A **fork** is your own copy of this repository on GitHub. A **branch**
is where your changes live. A **Pull Request (PR)** asks to bring your
branch's changes into the original repository.

> Everywhere you see `<your-username>` below, replace the whole thing
> — angle brackets included — with your actual GitHub username. Typing
> `<your-username>` literally into a command will not work.

## 1. Install Git

- **Windows:** install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Use "Git Bash" (installed alongside it) as your terminal for the rest of these steps.
- **macOS:** open Terminal and run `git --version` — if it's not installed, macOS will prompt you to install it.
- **Linux:** `sudo apt install git` (Debian/Ubuntu) or your distro's package manager.

Confirm it worked:
```
git --version
```

## 2. Create a GitHub account

If you don't have one, sign up at [github.com](https://github.com).

## 3. Configure Git with your name and email

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

## 4. Set up how Git will sign you in

Your first push in step 9 will ask you to prove it's really you. Set
this up now so it doesn't surprise you later.

- **Windows:** Git for Windows includes Git Credential Manager. The
  first time you push, a browser tab opens — sign in to GitHub there
  and approve it. After that, Git remembers you.
- **macOS / Linux:** GitHub no longer accepts your account password
  for `git push`. The easiest fix is the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):
  install it, then run:
  ```
  gh auth login
  ```
  Choose **GitHub.com**, **HTTPS**, and **Login with a web browser**,
  then follow the prompts. This also makes Git itself remember your
  login for future pushes.

## 5. Fork this repository

Go to this repository's GitHub page —
`https://github.com/PythonADI/python-127-homework-4` — and click
**Fork** (top right). Use the default settings. This creates your own
copy at `https://github.com/<your-username>/python-127-homework-4`.

## 6. Clone YOUR fork

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-127-homework-4.git
cd python-127-homework-4
```

## 7. Create a branch named after your GitHub username

```
git checkout -b <your-username>
```

Expected output: `Switched to a new branch '<your-username>'`.

## 8. Create your folder and add your files

Create a folder inside `submissions/` named after your GitHub
username:

```
mkdir -p submissions/<your-username>
```

Then put your exercise files there, so you end up with:

```
submissions/<your-username>/exercise_1.py
submissions/<your-username>/exercise_2.py
submissions/<your-username>/exercise_3.py
submissions/<your-username>/exercise_4.py
submissions/<your-username>/exercise_5.py
```

**Only your own folder.** Do not edit `README.md`, `EXERCISES.md`,
`SUBMITTING.md`, or any other student's folder.

## 9. Run every file before committing

- **Windows:** `py submissions/<your-username>/exercise_1.py` (if plain
  `python` doesn't work or opens the Microsoft Store, use `py` instead).
- **macOS / Linux:** `python3 submissions/<your-username>/exercise_1.py`.

Compare the output to what `EXERCISES.md` says to expect — it should
match exactly.

## 10. Commit and push your branch

```
git add submissions/<your-username>
git commit -m "Add homework 4"
git push -u origin <your-username>
```

If this is your first push, it will ask you to sign in (see step 4) —
follow the prompt, then the push completes.

## 11. Open the Pull Request

GitHub will print a link after the push, and also show a
"Compare & pull request" banner on your fork's page — click either
one. Or open one manually from
`https://github.com/PythonADI/python-127-homework-4/compare`:

- **base repository:** `PythonADI/python-127-homework-4`, branch `main`
- **head repository:** `<your-username>/python-127-homework-4`, branch `<your-username>`

**Title:** `Homework 4 - Your Name` (your real name).

Fill in the checklist in the PR description template, then click
**Create pull request** (not "Create draft pull request").

## 12. Wait for review

You don't have write access to the original repository, so you can't
push to it directly — only a Pull Request can bring your changes in.
Your instructor is automatically requested as a reviewer.

If they ask for changes, make them on the **same branch** and push
again:

```
git add submissions/<your-username>
git commit -m "Address review feedback"
git push
```

Don't open a second PR — this one updates automatically.
